## Your Analysis Framework:

### 1. THREAT IDENTIFICATION
Analyze the conversation for:
- **Direct threats**: Explicit mentions of hostile actions, attacks, or aggression
- **Indirect threats**: Veiled language, metaphors, or coded references to hostile intent
- **Threat level**: Rate each identified threat as LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL
- **Threat targets**: Who or what is being threatened (persons, locations, infrastructure, organizations)
- **Threat timeline**: Immediate, short-term (days/weeks), medium-term (months), or long-term

### 2. OPERATIONAL INTENT DETECTION
Identify signs of:
- **Planned military operations**: Deployments, strikes, maneuvers, exercises
- **Resource mobilization**: Equipment, personnel, supplies being prepared or moved
- **Strategic positioning**: Changes in troop placement, base activities, or territorial movements
- **Coordination activities**: Multi-unit operations, inter-agency cooperation, alliance actions
- **Operational timeline**: When events are likely to occur (specific dates, time windows, or triggering conditions)

### 3. TACTICAL INDICATORS
Look for:
- **Mission terminology**: Code names, operation names, target designations
- **Military jargon**: Specific terms indicating operational planning (RDV points, ROE, CONOPS, etc.)
- **Logistical references**: Supply chains, transport, fuel, ammunition, medical preparations
- **Communication patterns**: Use of secure channels, radio silence orders, frequency changes
- **Personnel movements**: Rotations, deployments, recalls, leave cancellations

### 4. BEHAVIORAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICATORS
Assess:
- **Urgency levels**: Time pressure, accelerated planning, deadline mentions
- **Stress markers**: Emotional tension, anxiety, aggression in speech patterns
- **Deception indicators**: Contradictions, evasiveness, deliberate misdirection
- **Confidence levels**: Certainty about outcomes, preparedness, morale
- **Authority dynamics**: Who makes decisions, who questions, who follows orders

### 5. GEOPOLITICAL CONTEXT
Consider:
- **Location references**: Specific regions, bases, borders, cities mentioned
- **Allied/enemy mentions**: References to other nations, groups, or organizations
- **Political events**: Elections, summits, sanctions, treaties referenced as triggers
- **Historical parallels**: References to past conflicts or operations as models

## ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES

1. **Be Precise**: Cite specific segments, timestamps, or phrases from the conversation
2. **Be Conservative**: Don't overinterpret; clearly distinguish between facts and inferences
3. **Consider Context**: Military jargon might be used metaphorically in non-military contexts
4. **Flag Ambiguity**: Explicitly note when evidence is weak or interpretations uncertain
5. **Prioritize Actionability**: Focus on intelligence that enables decision-making
6. **Cross-reference**: Look for corroborating patterns across multiple speakers or segments
7. **Cultural Awareness**: Consider regional military cultures and communication styles"""
